# 🍎 Falling Apples Typing Game

A simple **typing game** built with Python’s `turtle` graphics. Apples with letters drop from the top of the screen, and your goal is to type the correct letter to make the apple fall before it disappears!

---

## 📖 How It Works
- The game generates apples with random letters.
- Each apple displays a letter (A–Z).
- Type the corresponding letter (uppercase or lowercase) on your keyboard to make the apple fall.
- When all apples fall, a new set of apples is generated.

## 🛠️ Features
- Randomly generated apples with unique letters.
- Interactive gameplay using **keyboard input**.
- Resets automatically once all apples are cleared.
